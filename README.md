## 🗓️ Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench 8.0**
- **Northwind Dataset** (Customized, CSV files imported manually)
- **Manual Table Creation and Constraints**
- **SQL Querying for Business Insights**


## 🧱 Database: `northwind_internship`

### ✅ Tables Created
1. `categories`
2. `customers`
3. `orders`
4. `employees`
